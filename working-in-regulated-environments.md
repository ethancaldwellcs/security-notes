## Working Security in Regulated Environments

Security work in regulated environments feels different than how it’s often described online.

Constraints are constant. Compliance, audits, legacy systems, and limited staffing shape almost every decision.

### Controls vs reality

A common issue is the gap between written controls and actual practice.

Examples I’ve run into:
- Controls that exist but aren’t consistently followed
- Processes that rely on tribal knowledge
- Tools that technically meet requirements but lack ownership

Most audit findings aren’t about missing tools. They’re about inconsistency.

### Documentation is part of the job

Early on, I underestimated how important documentation was. It felt secondary to “real” security work.

In regulated environments, documentation *is* part of the security control. If something only exists in someone’s head, it effectively doesn’t exist.

### Tradeoffs are unavoidable

Security decisions are rarely about doing the best possible thing. They’re about doing the best thing that fits the constraints.

Budget, time, staffing, and business priorities all matter. Learning to work within those limits without becoming cynical is part of the job.

The most effective teams I’ve seen accept the constraints and focus on steady improvement rather than ideal solutions.
